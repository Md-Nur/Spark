              Powering Up Batch 8: Meet the Spark Plugs!
            </h1>
            <p className="py-6">
              Our batch is fueled by the dedication of our very own Class
              Representatives (CRs), Muhammad Nur from Dhaka and Tousif Iqti
              from Rangpur. These two dynamos are like a well-wired circuit â€“
              perfectly in sync and always reliable. You can count on them to
              keep the current flowing, whether it&apos;s delivering important
              announcements or sparking solutions to any academic hurdles. Their
              friendship ensures a positive charge runs through the batch, and
              their commitment to duty is unwavering. So, if you have a question
              or need a classmate connection, look no further than our trusty CR
              duo!
